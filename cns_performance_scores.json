Even though our physical bodies change, what makes 'me' me is the thread of experiences, memories, and self-awareness that connects my past to my present. It's like a river - the water is always changing but the river remains the same pattern.",

It's the difference between a computer recognizing an image and me actually seeing red and feeling the warmth of color. There's something it's like to be conscious, a qualitative inner world that emerges from complex information processing.",

When I feel anxiety about a choice, it signals potential risks my logical mind might miss.
